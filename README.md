# DoNation - "Donate for a good cause"

DoNation was developed with the intention of making it simple for anyone to contribute to the nation's quality and equal chances for children's well-being. Additionally, we want to raise awareness of the value of children's wellbeing. We experience empathy and compassion when we see children suffering, which motivates us to build a contribution platform and assist those kids who are in need.

### What it does
We at DoNation offer a platform for individuals and organizations to donate money for children's education that improves their problem-solving, communication, and other abilities that prepare them for the future. On our site, there are two ways to use our platform: as a donor or as a nonprofit organization. Through sponsorship, we are able to encourage the kids to go to school and teach them some fundamental life skills.

### How we built it
To develop the frontend of our website, We utilized the framework ReactJS and combined it with Tailwind CSS to create a clean and intuitive interface. Using Vercel , We were able to quickly set up a small web server to host our website. For the Backend Purpose of our website we've used Firebase. Finally, We connect it with our frontend using firebase method. 
- React JS

### Challenges we ran into
Since this was our first offline hackathon, we were quite enthusiastic about it and eager to create something that addressed a real-world issue. Our team has been working quite hard on this hackathon for the last 1.5 days. We encountered some difficulties, such as the need to work continuously with few pauses. Since we were participating in a hackathon, it is inevitable that we would encounter certain technical problems and defects in our code. Fortunately, our team was able to resolve all of these concerns.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are incredibly proud of what we were able to achieve during the hackathon. Despite facing some challenges, such as limited time and working with unfamiliar technologies, we managed to code a fully functional website .

We gained some valuable experience and knowledge from the hackathon, learning to use new technologies that we had previously only had limited exposure to. Overcoming obstacles such as limited time and competing priorities taught us the importance of effective time management and the need to prioritize tasks.

This experience has given us a great sense of accomplishment and has motivated us to continue exploring new technologies and improving our skills. The hackathon also provided us with an opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals and collaborate with others, which was a great learning experience in itself. Overall, we were thrilled with what we were able to achieve and grateful for the opportunity to participate in the hackathon.

### What we learned
We were able to comprehend and examine the state of children's education in our nation while we built this platform. We learned about some incredible technologies, such as Firebase, Vercel, etc., as this was our first offline hackathon. We used several new tools and techniques and got some useful experience. We are eager to continue honing our web development talents.

### What's next for DoNation
We came to the realization that there is always room for expansion and development when we thought back on our experience with this project. We'd like to completely deploy the delivery partners feature. Users would be able to communicate with one another, exchange concepts, and take part in conversations about how to educate kids. In addition, before delivering NGOs instructions, we would like to have them verified. In order to make transactions simple and practical, we also wish to incorporate the Stripe payment gateway.
